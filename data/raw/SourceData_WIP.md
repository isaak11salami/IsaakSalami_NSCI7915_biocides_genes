SourceData.xlsx contains the source data from the publication, "Systematic analyses identify modes of action of ten clinically relevant biocides and antibiotic antagonism in Acinetobacter baumannii" (Li et al., 2023) DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-023-01474-z. The data file was downloaded from https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01474-z#Sec27 on 23/03/2025 (originally titled "Source Data Fig 1." on the webpage)

This file contains multiple data sets, each used in the generation of the title-associated figures/tables presented in the publication. In brief, each dataset describes the log-fold change in A.baumannii BAL062's expression of genes following exposure to a biocide. With the exception of the first page, titled "All data", this BAL062 column is followed by a column title AB5075. This column lists the locus tags of the genes/proteins corresponding to the initial locus tags listed for  A.baumannii BAL062. This is included to provide context for the BAL062 genes to viewers who are already familiar with the more popular A.baumannii AB5075 strain. These columns of gene locus tags are followed by another column of reference information that lists the functions of each gene's protein.For genes with unknown protein functions, the description of "hypothetical protein" is given.
The subsequent columns provide the dependent data. This data is grouped into columns of 3. The first column lists the log-fold change in the gene expression, and the biocide used in the particular test. For example, in the D column of the "All data" page, the column is titled "logFC_AgNO3". This translates to "log-fold change following treatment with the AgNO3 biocide". This dependent variable is followed by two descriptive statistics, a p.value and a q.value. This set of 3 values to describe the dependent variable are repeated for each biocide tested.

The first page of .xlsx file contains all the data for all the genes assessed. The subsequent pages of the file break this down into subsets of genes, with the titles of the pages describing each specific subset. 
"Figure 2A": Data used to construct Figure 2A in the publication
"Figure 2B": Data used to construct Figure 2B in the publication
"Extended Data Figure 4": Data used to construct Extended Data Figure 4 in the publication
"TCA": The subset of genes annotated as being associated with the Tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)
"Nucleotide": The subset of genes annotated as being associated with nucleotide synthesis
"Amino Acid": The subset of genes annotated as being associated with amino acid synthesis
"Others": The subset of genes with annotations that don't fit with any of the other listed groupings of interest
"Hypothetical": The subset of genes lacking annotated functions. Thus, they are "hypothetical" proteins
"Transcriptional regulators": The subset of genes annotated as being transcriptional regulators
