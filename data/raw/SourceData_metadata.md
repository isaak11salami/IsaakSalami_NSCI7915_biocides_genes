SourceData.xlsx contains the source data from the publication, "Systematic analyses identify modes of action of ten clinically relevant biocides and antibiotic antagonism in Acinetobacter baumannii" (Li et al., 2023) DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-023-01474-z.

This file contains multiple data sets, each used in the generation of the title-associated figures/tables presented in the publication. In brief, each dataset describes the log-fold change in A.baumannii BAL062's expression of genes following exposure to a biocide. 

Independent Variable(s)

The independent variable is this experiment is the type of biocide used in each treatment.
There are 10 levels to this independent variable: AgNO3 (silver nitrate), BZK (benzalkonium), CTAB cetryltrimethylammonium bromide), CHL (chlorhexidine), TRC (triclosan), CRL (chloroxylenol), PVPi (polyvidone iodine), HClO (sodium hypochlorite), GLU (glutaraldehyde) and EtOH (ethanol).


Dependent Variable(s)
The dependent variable is this experiment is the change in gene expression in A.baumannii BAL062 resulting from biocide treatment. Gene expression was analysed using TraDIS sequencing and compared against the average expression of 6 negative controls (no biocide). However, as only the log-fold change of expression is presented in this data set, the raw data regarding this negative control is not presented.
For each biocide (independent var.) used in the experiment, the resulting expression data (dependent var.) is grouped into three columns.The first column lists the log-fold change in the gene expression resulting from the biocide treatment.For example, in the D column of the "All data" page, the column is titled "logFC_AgNO3". This translates to "log-fold change following treatment with the AgNO3 biocide". This dependent variable is followed by two descriptive statistics, a p.value and a q.value.

The expression data is listed for each gene assessed. These genes are identified in three different ways. First, the BAL062 provides the locus tag for each gene. With the exception of the first page titled "All data", this BAL062 column is followed by a column title AB5075. This column lists the corresponding locus tags of the genes in a second strain, A.baumannii AB5075. This is included to provide context for the BAL062 genes to readers who are already familiar with the more popular A.baumannii AB5075 strain. These columns of gene locus tags are then followed by a column of standard gene names (if available). This is followed by a final column of reference information that lists the functions of each gene's protein (if known). For genes with unknown protein functions, the description of "hypothetical protein" is given.

Additional Information about the Dataset

The first page of .xlsx file contains the data for all the genes assessed for log-fold change in expression. The subsequent pages of the file break this down into subsets of genes, with the titles of the pages describing each specific subset.

"Figure 2B": Data used to construct Figure 2B in the publication
"Extended Data Figure 4": Data used to construct Extended Data Figure 4 in the publication
"TCA": The subset of genes annotated as being associated with the Tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)
