cells.csv is a copy of one of the multiple pages in the SourceData.xlsx file. Specifically, it is a copy of the page titled "Figure 2A". As explained in SourceData_metadata, this page contains the subset of data (subset of gene expressions) used to construct  Figure 2A in the publication "Systematic analyses identify modes of action of ten clinically relevant biocides and antibiotic antagonism in Acinetobacter baumannii" (Li et al., 2023) DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-023-01474-z. More specifically, cell A1 of the .csv identifies this subset of genes as belonging to K-CSU-LOS (the K locus). Thus, this dataset subsets the data from Figure 2A for the genes associated with the K-locus

This page of the SourceData.xlsx file was separated to allow for easier analysis of this specific subset of genes in R studio. For a full explanation of the independent and dependent variables listed in this file, please refer to SourceData_metadata. Briefly, the independent variable is biocide used to treat an A.baumannii BAL062. The dependent variable is the log fold-change in gene expression in A.baumannii BAL062 resulting from biocide treatment. These changes in expression are reported for each gene assessed.
